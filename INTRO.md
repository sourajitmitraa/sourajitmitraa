## about me

<!--
My name is Sourajit Mitra and my origins lie in the urban backdrop of Bengal.
Currently 19 years old and pursuing my ambitions in the data handling fields as well as a keen interest in CLoud Technology in Jain Deemed-to-be Universiy Bengaluru, I am also an active member in American Football, football as well as the Rowing Teams.

I am not working on anything at the moment but I will soon undertake case studies to further solidify my grasp on the concepts of data analytics. 
Hoping to be the best version of myself, both in society and in the coding arena.
Toodles!
